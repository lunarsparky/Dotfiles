# Dotfile

Welcome to my (work in progress) dotfiles. Now using [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) for dotfile management, as it does everything I want and more. As a bonus, works on both MacOS and Linux. This was also setup with yadm, and going forward I may attempt to support both. Yadm is keep it simple while Chezmoi has advanced features.

This repo will be modular in design, with sensitive files handled by yadm or called out below

This repo is licenced under the `WTFPL`. Have fun.

## Files not tracked
- `.environment.zsh` - Local variables and similar that are sensitive in nature, such as API keys
